# Maze resoltuion with tabular methods of reinforcement learning algorithms
Working with two different models, the resolution of a maze (from the Maze environment of the Gym library) was achieved via reinforcement learning.

Both methods were tabular. The first one consisted of the basics of RL, the policy iteration method, in which an algorithm is developed to explore all possible states to find the optimal policy for solving the maze. The second one was a Monte Carlo method, where the system dynamics are not known, and the values of the states (precisely the Q-values) are estimated using an efficient algorithm.
